\chapter{Preface}
One chapter in dissertation involve co-authored work. Chapter 3 (Political Party Control and Intergovernmental Grants: a Panel Data
Analysis) is co-authored with Dr Odd. Stalebrink at Pennsylvania State University. I am the first author of chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 4, chapter 5, chapter 6 and second author of Chapter 3. I received the approval letters from the Graduate School at Pennsylvania State University to include Chapter 3 in my dissertation (see Appendix C).

Chapter 3 is a empirical investigation on how federal transfer payments are influenced by political objectives, highlighting U.S. governance's political nuances.

Regarding the specific contributions to Chapter 3, I was responsible for co-developing the research question, collecting and organizing primary literature, gathering necessary data, designing the research methodology, and writing the code to generate tables and graphs. Based on the content above, I drafted an initial version.

Dr. Stalebrink contribute substantial value to Chapter 3, especially in the manuscript's writing aspects. He conducted extensive revisions, including restructuring the paper and rewriting a lot of parts such as the introduction, literature review, and hypotheses based on the initial draft. His contributions enhanced the quality of the paper. Dr. Stalebrink's expertise and his efforts in the writing process provided crucial academic support for chapter 3.
