\chapter{Summary, Thoughts and Rethink}

Though fiscal system is a very big topic, one can always capture the key points by analyzing two vital sectors---resource collection and reallocation. The reallocation process is a public goods provision process. All the other research questions are somewhat pertained to this main stream. One key word that no one can avoid when trying to understand the resource reallocate and public goods provision process is "tradeoff". Basically all fiscal system mechanism design is a compromise of different aspects. Fiscal federalism is one particular system that wildly adopted by both developed and developing countries. In this chapter, I want to extract some thoughts that spread all over the fiscal system investigation, which also accounts to a summary of this thesis.

\section{Overall Interests and Partial Interests}
One contradiction that any fiscal system cannot avoid is the overall interests and partial interests. This tradeoff is an widespread concern in fiscal federalism investigation. For example, this tradeoff is  In fiscal federalism system, at least two layers of government exists---national government and multiple layers of subnational governments. National government care about the benefits for all regions while subnational governments focus merely on their own region. Due to this inconsistency, national government would adjust the public provision condition by intergovernmental transfer to better suits the overall interests. I try to reflect this inconsistency in the dynamic complete  game model in Chapter 2. The equilibrium result shows the necessity of general transfer and joint provision. In short, national governments adopt general transfer and joint provision to better serve the overall interests, even though this may not be a goods news for all subnational regions.

Besides, the tradeoff between overall and partial interests is also reflected in the consideration of externality. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Externality is also an very important concern. Though I didn't express the externality factor in the utility function in this thesis, the national government conflict local regions's interests due to externality is so common that can be found in both developed and developing countries, involving all kinds of public goods such as environment pollution, inter-state highway construction and public education\cite{1988Foreign, Branstetter2001Are, 2011Procurement}.

Except for the utility discordance between national and local governments, another example for the overall and partial interests tradeoff is the
